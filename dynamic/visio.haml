  Through the use of Data Graphics we can help your team visualize your metrics 
  in a simple customizable drill down format. Think Global metrics of a company 
  with the ability to drill down to the specific city or store that you are 
  tracking your metrics against. This applies to all types of industries and 
  any type of SQL database accessible information. We arenâ€™t stuck with out of 
  the box graphics either, we can create, modify and integrate your companies 
  graphics into a comprehensive no-nonsense easy to use Business Intelligence 
  (BI) metrics tracking tool that can be used from the top to track high level 
  business data clear to the base users of your organization to track their 
  daily work load.

  Give us a chance to show you how Visio can revolutionize your business 
  intelligence metrics reporting.
