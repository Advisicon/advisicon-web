    Customers frequently struggle with the best approach to manage operational 
    work while maintaining the integrity and details of their project work. 
    Operational work can include things like vacation time, sick time, training, 
    or general projects that keep the business functioning such as building 
    maintenance or computer server maintenance. During the demonstration, 
    participants will learn about 3 distinct approaches and their advantages 
    and disadvantages for businesses. While not revealing confidential 
    information, this presentation will showcase the struggle an estimated 15 
    Project Online/Project Server customers went through and how they decided 
    upon their approach.  There is certainly a give and take in regards to 
    effort to set up and support different approaches. Some important 
    considerations that will be addressed include operational planning by 
    executives, PMs, resource managers, and team members and how responsibility 
    for different levels of detail can be handed out. This presentation will 
    include mapping of features to PMI PMBOK methodology and how specific 
    features can address business needs related to scope management, rolling 
    wave planning, agile methodology, and progressive elaboration. In keeping 
    with the need to report to executives, attendees will learn how these 
    approaches affect the portfolio analysis or other portfolio views and how 
    executives or PMO staff can drive decision making that truly includes all 
    the work of the business.

      In most organizations capturing and managing details within agile or 
      development teams proves difficult for project managers.  In many cases 
      development teams use other tools, including Visual Studio or Team Foundation 
      Server (TFS) to manage tasks, check in code and work in development sprints, 
      features, testing and quality assurance activities.
    %p   
      There is a connector that brings the details being managed by development 
      teams to a Project or allows for project details to be loaded into Team 
      Foundation server.  This allows a project organization to sync and manage 
      development activities, without the need for PMs to mine data in a development 
      system or developers to have to go and manage tasks in Project Online or MS 
      Project.
    %p   
      By leveraging this connector, you can have the best of both worlds and ensure 
      that good demand and capacity planning is leveraged with Project or Project 
      Online, while keeping your technical teams focussed in the environment they 
      are familiar with.
