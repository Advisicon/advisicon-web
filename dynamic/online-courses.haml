  Online Classes
  ==============

  Short on time, but still want to learn?

  Often it is not feasible for you to leave your desk for an afternoon, let 
  alone an entire day or two. Advisicon now offers online training, allowing 
  you to continue investing in your project management knowledge base, while 
  not interfering with your on-going responsibilities. These courses are 
  offered in shorter consecutive sessions (e.g., 2 hour sessions for 5 
  consecutive days) to accommodate the demands of a daily job.

  Interactive and engaging, our online courses are designed for you to learn 
  practical material that you can put to use immediately.
