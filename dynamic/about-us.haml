  Who is Advisicon?
  =================

  Advisicon delivers strategic project management solutions using advanced project 
  and portfolio management methodologies, custom application development and 
  comprehensive training. Our clients throughout North and Latin America 
  have realized quantifiable results through our three unique philosophy tenets: 
  knowledge transfer, optimization and sustained results. 
  

  Our Philosophy Defined
  --------------

  
  ### Optimization ###
  
  Advisicon integrates project management best practices along with project
  management technologies to fit each client's organizational structure, strategy
  and culture.

  
  ### Knowledge Transfer ###

  Advisicon teaches clients to internalize and standardize project management 
  best practices and use of technology. Clients receive task-specific coaching, 
  in-depth process development, customized project management methodology and 
  supervised training with the technology.


  ### Sustained Results ###
  
  Through our phased approach, our clients are able to adopt and implement 
  strategic project management improvements, one step at a time. Clients grow from 
  one level of project management maturity to the next at their own pace. Through 
  this process of optimization and knowledge transfer, Advisicon delivers sustained results 
  to our clients.
