Github for Advisicon: Put SharePoint to Shame
=============================================

Get ready to make some awesome stuff with github for Advisicon!

Getting Started
---------------

You've already completed the first two steps: you've got a github account and you've had it associated with the advisicon-web distro.

Since you're probably using Windows, you should install the appropriate tools to push and pull. If you would prefer to work with a GUI, give [GitHub Windows](http://windows.github.com/ "download github for windows") a try.

Github is built off of [git](http://git-scm.com/ "download git"), an amazing version control and file sharing system.

What Is This HAML Stuff?
------------------------

Don't worry too much about it. Haml is just a really awesome HTML abstraction written in Ruby.

You'll find the haml in `dynamic/`.

The top bit is YAML. Here's a snippit from the sharepoint.haml file:

~~~
title: SharePoint
keywords: Microsoft, SharePoint, Training, Deployment, Customization
description: About Advisicon&rsquo;s Microsoft SharePoint training, deployment, and customization
employee_name:
layout: base-alt/default.haml
